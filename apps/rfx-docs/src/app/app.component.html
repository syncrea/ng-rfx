  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Install ng-rfx from npm:</p>
  <pre><code highlight="npm install --save ng-rfx"></code></pre>
  <h3>Form Model and Typed Form Controls</h3>
  <p>One of the core features of ng-rfx is to provide simple type-safety for your forms. You can leverage the utilities of ng-rfx without importing any NgModule in your application. Just use ng-rfx typed form controls over the standard form controls of Angular. Start by defining your forms using a simple interface.</p>
  <pre><code highlight="interface SimpleForm {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}"></code></pre>
  <p>Now you can use the typed form controls of ng-rfx and get rid of the no. 1 pain while implementing forms. Missing type information in forms can ruin the day (and your whole project!).</p>
  <pre><code highlight="import {TypedFormGroup, TypedFormControl} from 'ng-rfx';

const control = new TypedFormGroup<SimpleForm>({
  firstName: new TypedFormControl<string>('First name'),
  lastName: new TypedFormControl<string>('Last name')
});"></code></pre>
  <p>You can use the new typed methods to handle your forms in a type-safe way:</p>
  <pre><code highlight="control.setValue({
  firstName: 'Updated first',
  lastName: 'Updated last'
});"></code></pre>
  <p>Inside of your view, you can access the typed children of your form group to create form control bindings:</p>
  <pre><code highlight="<input [formControl]=&quot;control.typedGet('firstName')&quot;  type=&quot;text&quot;>"></code></pre>

  <h2>Declaratively create your forms using form definitions</h2>
  <p>By using ng-rfx form definition object, you can manage your form configurations in a declarative way. Later on, just use the creatForm helper to create instances of your definitions. Thanks to the conditional generic typing mechanisms behind form definitions, you can enjoy full type-safety and editor auto-completion within your definitions.</p>
  <pre><code highlight="import {createForm, FormDefinition} from 'ng-rfx';
import {Validators} from '@angular/forms';

export interface PersonForm {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  address: {
    street: string;
    no: number;
  }
}

export const personFormDefinition: FormDefinition<PersonForm> = {
  type: 'Group',
  fields: {
    firstName: {
      type: 'Field',
      initialValue: 'Peter',
      options: {
        validators: [Validators.required]
      }
    },
    lastName: 'Pan',
    address: {
      type: 'Group',
      fields: {
        street: 'Neverlandstreet',
        no: 12
      }
    }
  }
};

const personFormGroup = createForm(personFormDefinition);
const {firstName, lastName, address: {street, no}} = personFormGroup.typedValue;
console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} lives at ${street} ${no}`);"></code></pre>

<h2>Using Angular 14 native typed controls</h2>
  <p>Angular 14 has introduced a major improvement by incorporating strong typing with forms,
    a development that is sure to resolve a major issue with form handling in Angular, as well
    as resolve one of the major concerns of ng-rfx. This is great news for developers. However,
    despite this improvement, ng-rfx still offers several other benefits, including its definition-first
    approach and the resulting simplified instantiation handling.</p>

  <p>Angular's approach differs from ng-rfx in that it adopts a control type definition design
    as opposed to a value-first definition. This approach solves the one issue that ng-rfx cannot solve
    without a little help, which is the correct type inference of FormControls that have an object
    value type. To address this in ng-rfx, you need to use the getCustomValue helper. On the other
    hand, with Angular, you can't use your simple domain models as the source of your form definitions, which
    might still be attractive enough for you to keep ng-rfx as your form helper library.</p>

  <p>For Angular as a framework, we believe the decision to prioritize consistency over convenience was
    the right one. The ng-rfx library was always meant as a form ultility package for Angular and never ment to replace
    anything of Angular. We believe there are still plenty of convenience features to keep using ng-rfx utilities for Angular 14+.</p>

  <p>Besides Angular 15 support with our own typed control wrapper classes, we have also added a new helper to create native Angular controls
    from your existing form definitions. This way you can decide to still use the form definition feature of ng-rfx, but rely on the native typed controls.
  </p>
  <pre><code highlight="import {createNativeForm, FormDefinition} from 'ng-rfx';
import {Validators} from '@angular/forms';

export interface PersonForm {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  address: {
    street: string;
    no: number;
  }
}

export const personFormDefinition: FormDefinition<PersonForm> = {
  type: 'Group',
  fields: {
    firstName: {
      type: 'Field',
      initialValue: 'Peter',
      options: {
        validators: [Validators.required]
      }
    },
    lastName: 'Pan',
    address: {
      type: 'Group',
      fields: {
        street: 'Neverlandstreet',
        no: 12
      }
    }
  }
};

const personFormGroup = createNativeForm(personFormDefinition);
const {firstName, lastName, address: {street, no}} = personFormGroup.value;
console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} lives at ${street} ${no}`);"></code></pre>
